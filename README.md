Lazy Load for Videos by [Kevin Weber](//www.kweber.com)
====================

This plugin improves page load times and increases your Google PageSpeed Score. It replaces embedded Youtube and Vimeo videos with a clickable preview image.
By loading the videos only when the user clicks on the preview image, no unnecessary JavaScript is loaded. Especially on sites with many embedded videos this will make your visitors happy.
